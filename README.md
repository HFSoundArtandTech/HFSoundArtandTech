- 👋 Hi, I’m @HiFyStudio aka Fy or Sagan,
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, especially but not limited to: Python,HTML,CSS, JavaScript,home and business automation, and automation for adaptive and disability assistance of all kinds. I myself am disabled from a stroke in 2020, but have had considerable good fortune in my recovery and am happy to be able to function as much as I do. I practice meditation, mindfulness and Zen Buddhism.I also want to help find ways to heal our planet and think that we can leverage tech to help us with this healing process. My specialization lies in the fields of sound, audio and music and I am very interested in music technology as well as computer music.<br> 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as well as working on my first full stack projects for hosting a blog site in html. It has taken me a full year to get a handle on the overall landscape of web development and in knowing I have a lot left to learn, this is the best synopsis that I can currently give. Thank you for reading...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects music or Art related as well as anything sustainability or accessibility related as well. I really enjoy generative music and composition. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... send me a message here on github, or email us at: <sagan@hifystudio.com>
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, xe, thon...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to play violin and guitar but had a stroke in 2020 and lost the use of my left arm and hand, so i've turned toward technology and coding to help me to adjust and adapt to a new way of life while continuing to work creatively in music...
