- 👋 Hi, I’m @HFSoundArtandTech aka SW-Fyb.org
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, for sure but spedcifically Python, home and business automation, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, still. I'm currently working on my first glitch.com site.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything music or Art related. Ok, not ANYTHING anything, but MANY different things. I really enjoy generative music and composition. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, xe, thon...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to play violin and guitar but had a stroke in 2020 and lost the use of my left arm and hand, so i've turned toward technology and coding to help me to adjust and adapt to a new way of life while continuing to work creatively in music...
